    <p>
      Brontosaurus, or just Brontie, was born in April 2019 in Bangor Michigan.
      She spent her first six months with her dino litter-mates and mom at my
      cousin's farm, until I brought her to Lexington in Nov. 2019.
      Brontie is a typical tortie and very sassy and independant.
      She loves going outside and hunting. Generally not a fan of other cats,
      Brontie has a new friend Liopleurodon, who she is slowly warming up
      to.
